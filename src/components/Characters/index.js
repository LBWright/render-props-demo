export { default } from './Characters';
// export { default as CharacterList } from './CharacterList';
// export { default as CharacterItem } from './CharacterItem';
// export { default as NewCharacterForm } from './NewCharacterForm';

// When we use the index.js for this style of naming, it allows us to export our
// default imports as named exports. This basically creates for us a 'default'
// package for people to use when they use our application
// the primary export is default. This default is where the logic of our
// application lives and can be used anywhere.

// this is powerful because of its reusability. We could rename this entire package
// into something that could be used anywhere: Crud.
